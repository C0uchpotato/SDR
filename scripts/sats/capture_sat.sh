#!/usr/bin/env bash
# capture_sat.sh
# Usage:
#   ./capture_sat.sh apt 137.100M 600 outbase [gain]
#   ./capture_sat.sh meteor 137900000 600 outbase [gain]
#
# Modes:
#   - apt    : record an APT pass (analog NOAA historical style). Produces outbase.wav and tries to run noaa-apt to make PNG.
#   - meteor : record raw IQ/baseband for LRPT (Meteor). Produces outbase.u8 (unsigned 8-bit IQ). Decode with SatDump (examples printed).
#
# Notes:
#  - This script just *records* the pass for a fixed duration (seconds). Use a pass predictor (Heavens-Above / N2YO / SatDump scheduler) to start at AOS.
#  - Adjust sample rate and gain for your hardware/antenna. Typical Meteor sample rates: 900k-1.024Msps; APT: audio centered ~60k.
#  - Requires rtl_fm / rtl_sdr / sox to be in PATH. SatDump is optional (used to decode LRPT files).
